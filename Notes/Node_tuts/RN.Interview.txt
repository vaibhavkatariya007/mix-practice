How to implement session based auth?

Q1. How many threads run in React Native?
Ans. The React Native app contains the following thread:
React Native UI Thread (Main Thread): 
This thread is used for the layout of the mobile app.
React Native JavaScript Thread: 
It is a thread where our business logic will run. It means JS thread is a
 place where our JavaScript code is executed.
React Native Modules Thread: 
Sometimes, our app needs access to platform API, which happens as a part
 of native module thread.
React Native Render Thread: This thread is used to generate actual OpenGL 
commands used to draw the app UI.

Q2. Are all React components usable in React Native?
React web components use DOM elements (ex. div, h1, table, etc.) to display 
on UI. But, these components are not supported in React Native. You will need 
to find libraries or components which is made specifically for React Native. 
It is very hard to find that there are components available, which support 
both. But, it should be easy to figure out that the given components are made 
for React Native or not. Thus, it makes clear that all components are not 
usable in the React Native.

Q3.  How Virtual DOM works in React Native?
Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object, which is an in-memory 
representation of a real DOM.
 It is an intermediary step between the render function being called and 
 the displaying of elements on the screen. It is similar to a node tree, 
 which lists the elements, their attributes, and content as objects and 
 their properties. The render function creates a node tree of the React 
 components and then updates this node tree in response to the mutations 
 in the data model caused by various actions done by the user or by the system.

Virtual DOM works in three steps:

Whenever any data changes in the React App, the entire UI is re-rendered 
in Virtual DOM representation.
Now, the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new 
DOM is calculated.
Once the calculations are completed, the real DOM updated with only 
those things which are changed.

Q4.What does a StyleSheet.create do?
In React native, the StyleSheet.create() ensures that the values are 
immutable and opaque. They are used to send the style only once through 
the bridge to avoid passing a new style object.

Q5. While u access a camera u get base64 image, and ur api requires a file 
format how u will manage to send data?

Q6. How u send push notifications? And how to jump into the particular screen?

Q7.What are Refs in React Native?

Q8.What is meant by InteractionManager, and why it is Important?
The InteractionManager is a native module in React Native, which is 
responsible for differing the execution of a function until an interaction 
has finished. To handle this deferral, we need to call 
InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {...}).

The InteractionManager is important because React Native has two threads. 
One is JavaScript UI thread, which handles drawing updates to the screen, 
and the second thread used for all task, not on the UI thread.
Since React Native has only one thread for making UI updates, it can
get overloaded and drop frames, especially in navigation screen animations. 
So, developers use the InteractionManager to ensure that the function is 
executed after these animations occur. As a result, we do not drop frames
on the UI thread.

Q9.When would you prefer a class component over functional components?

Q10. How React Native handle different screen sizes?
React Native provides many ways to handle screen sizes. 
Some of them are given below:

1. Flexbox: It is used to provide a consistent layout on different screen 
sizes. It has three main properties:

flexDirection
justifyContent
alignItems

2. Pixel Ratio: It is used to get access to the device pixel density by 
using the PixelRatio class. We will get a higher resolution image if we 
are on a high pixel density device.

3. Dimensions: It is used to handle different screen sizes and 
style the page precisely. It needs to write the code only once for 
working on any device.

4. AspectRatio: It is used to set the height or vice versa. The aspectRatio 
is present only in React-Native, not a CSS standard.

5. ScrollView: It is a scrolling container which contains multiple 
components and view. The scrollable items can be scroll both vertically 
and horizontally.

Q11. What is the storage system in the React Native?
React Native storage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, 
persistent system, which stores the data globally in the app. 
It stores data in the form of a key-value pair. React Native provides 
AsyncStorage class to store data globally. Using the AsyncStorage class, 
we need to have a data backup and synchronization class. It is because data 
saved on the device is not permanent and not encrypted.

Q12. How to update React Native with the latest version?

Q13.What is meant by Gesture Responder System?
It is an internal system of React Native, which is responsible 
for managing the lifecycle of gestures in the system. React Native 
provides several different types of gestures to the users, such as tapping, 
sliding, swiping, and zooming. The responder system negotiates these touch 
interactions. Usually, it is used with Animated API. Also, it 
is advised that they never create irreversible gestures.
