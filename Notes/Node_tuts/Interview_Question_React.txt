REF: https://www.interviewbit.com/css-interview-questions/
----------
Q1.  What are the limitations of CSS?
Disadvantages of CSS are given below:

a) Browser Compatibility: 
Some style selectors are supported and some are not.
 We have to determine which style is supported or not using the @support selector).

b) Cross Browser issue: 
Some selectors behave differently in a different browser).

c) There is no parent selector: 
Currently, Using CSS, you can’t select a parent tag.


Q2. can i include one css file in another css?
 Import a stylesheet file (An external file imported into another CSS file): 
 Another way to add CSS is by using the @import rule. 
 This is to add a new CSS file within CSS itself.
@import "path/to/style.css";

Q3. Diff b/w SASS vs SCSS

SASS is based on indentation and SCSS(Sassy CSS) is not.
SASS uses .sass extension while SCSS uses .scss extension.
SASS doesn’t use curly brackets or semicolons. SCSS uses it, just like the CSS.

LESS: LESS is an acronym for “Leaner Stylesheets”. LESS is easy to add to any javascript projects by using NPM or less.js file. It uses the extension .less.

LESS syntax is the same as the SCSS with some exceptions. LESS uses @ to define the variables.

Stylus: Stylus offers a great deal of flexibility in writing syntax, supports native CSS as well as allows omission of brackets, colons, and semicolons.
 It doesn’t use @ or $ for defining variables.


Q4. What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?
It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport.
 It is used mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the 
 height of the viewport. If the height of the browser is 1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. 
 Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is equal to 10px.

Q5.Difference between reset vs normalize CSS?. How do they differ?
Reset CSS: CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling.
 For example margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be the same. 

Normalize CSS: Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers. 
It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.

Q6.What is a Pseudo element? What is pseudo-class?

Q7.What does DOM reflow occur?
Reflow is the name of the web browser process for re-calculating the positions 
and geometries of elements in the document, for the purpose of re-rendering part or 
all of the document. 

Reflow occurs when:

Insert, remove or update an element in the DOM.
Modify content on the page, e.g. the text in an input box.
Move a DOM element.
Animate a DOM element.
Take measurements of an element such as offsetHeight or getComputedStyle.
Change a CSS style

The four types of @media properties are:

All → It’s the default property. Used for all media-type devices.
Screen → Used for computer screen, mobile screen.

Q9.What does the :root pseudo-class refer to?
The :root selector allows you to target the highest-level “parent” element in the DOM, 
or document tree. It is defined in the CSS Selectors Level 3 specification.

Q10.  Difference between CSS grid vs flexbox?
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows. 
Grid layout is intended for larger-scale layouts which aren’t linear in design.

Flexbox is largely a one-dimensional system (either in a column or a row). 
Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application.

Q11. What do CSS Custom properties variables mean?
Custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables) 
are defined by users that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. 
The value is set using -- notion. And the values are accessed using the var() function.

ex.
:root {
	--main-bg-color: brown
}

.one {
	color: white;
	background-color· var (--main-bg-color);
	margin: l0px,
	width: 50px,
	height: 5Opx;
	display: inline-block;
}


Q12.  How to determine if the browser supports a certain feature?
The @support in CSS can be very useful to scan if the current browser has 
support for a certain feature.

@supports (display: grid) {
	div {
		display: grid;
	}
}
